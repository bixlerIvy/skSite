# About This Site #

First of all, thank you for taking the time to explore my website. Like many pages still say, it's in the very beginning stages. I'm slowly adding all my projects and interests to it. My vision for this website is to produce something I am genuinely happy with. I want this to be a show of my best work.

The site itself is built from scratch in HTML, CSS, and javascript. At some point I'd really like to get web python stuff working, but I just want to keep it simple until I have a real product.

To host the website I'm using GitHub Pages. If you've never checked it out, it's pretty cool!

Before I started this project I had minimal programming knowledge. As it stands I still consider my programming knowledge to be minimal. I have learned a lot though.

Not only have I learned about web programming through this project, but I’ve also learned a ton about source control. GitHub is such a powerful tool. It makes this side project feel much more real. It’s fun to be able to look at the amount of work I've put in over the 80 or so commits I've made to the repository. Maybe some time, I'll figure out how to embed some stats here.

If you find a typo, please email me.

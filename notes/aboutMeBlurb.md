# About Me #

It's so hard to write about my self haha.

I guess I'll start with some basics. 

Hi! My name is Ivy Bixler. My pronouns are she/they and I turn 20 in February.

I just officially moved to Massachussetts. I love it up here! I attend college at WPI as a computer science student.

I recently took some time off and this January is my first term back since October of 2022. At this point I've only taken 2 CS classes, but I'm eager to make progress on my degree. I've always been passionate about computers and I have spent much of my life in front of one.

That's it for now. Thanks!
